# Minor corrections:
# - Added `from collections import defaultdict` for easier dictionary construction.
# - Added `raise` in connection error handlers to propagate the exception.
# - Corrected local_bind_address in SSH tunnel setup (usually ('localhost', local_port) or ('127.0.0.1', local_port)).
#   The original used `ssh_host` which might be the remote server, not the local interface for binding.
#   For simplicity and common use, assuming `ssh_host` was intended as the local bind interface.
#   The host for `connect()` after tunnel should be the local bind host ('127.0.0.1' or 'localhost').
#   Changed `host=_host` to `host='127.0.0.1'` for SSH connections as a common default.
# - Ensured port in `get_mysql_db_connection` is int.
# - Added `ORDER BY table_name` to `retrieve_table_name_tuple_list_from_connected_schema`.
# - Added quoting for `table_name` in `retrieve_table_field_metadata` using backticks.
# - In `retrieve_all_foreign_keys_bulk`, added `REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL AND REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME IS NOT NULL` to WHERE clause.
# - In `retrieve_all_primary_keys_bulk` and `retrieve_all_unique_constraints_bulk`, added `AND tc.TABLE_NAME = kcu.TABLE_NAME` to JOIN condition for correctness.
# - Changed structure of `retrieve_all_foreign_keys_bulk` to store details under `COLUMN_NAME` as key. This assumes a simple model where a column has at most one FK constraint directly defined on it. If a column can be part of multiple FKs (e.g. as part of different composite keys), this structure would need adjustment (e.g. list of FKs per column or use CONSTRAINT_NAME as key). For this exercise, the requested structure `{ 'table1_name': { 'col1_name_fk': {fk_details}, ... }, ... }` implies keying by the column that *has* the FK.
# - The processing in `retrieve_all_columns_metadata_bulk` was adjusted to create the nested structure correctly.
# - `retrieve_all_unique_constraints_bulk` now returns `{table_name: {constraint_name: [col_list]}}`.
# - `retrieve_all_foreign_keys_bulk` structure: A column can only have one foreign key constraint directly naming it. However, a column can be *part* of multiple foreign key constraints if those are composite keys. The prompt's example `col1_name_fk` suggests the key in the inner dict is the column name itself that has the FK. This is what I implemented.
# - Corrected SSH tunnel connect host to '127.0.0.1' as is standard. The original `_host` was the remote DB host.
# - Corrected local_bind_address for SSH tunnel to be ('127.0.0.1', ssh_local_bind_port) as this is most common.
#   The original had (ssh_host, ssh_local_bind_port) which could be problematic if ssh_host is not a local interface.
#   Using ('127.0.0.1', ...) is safer for local binding.
# - The `retrieve_json_from_sql_query` is assumed to handle the cursor execution and fetching into a list of dicts.
# - The `print(f"Failed to connect: {e}")` lines are kept; in a real app, proper logging would be used.
# - For SSH tunnels, the `host` parameter in `connect()` should be the local address the tunnel binds to, typically '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost', and `port` should be `tunnel.local_bind_port`.
#   The original code used `_host` (the remote DB host) for `host` in `connect` after tunnel. This is incorrect.
#   I have changed this to `host='127.0.0.1'` in the SSH connection functions.
# - The `local_bind_address` for `SSHTunnelForwarder` was `(ssh_host, ssh_local_bind_port)`. If `ssh_host` is the remote SSH server's hostname/IP, this is not correct for the *local* bind address. It should be a local interface like '127.0.0.1' or '0.0.0.0'. I've changed this to `('127.0.0.1', ssh_local_bind_port)`.
